#Whac-a-mole

Unity version:2019.4.15f
Made ford android, tested on XiaoMi Mi 9 SE (Android 10)
Should work on iOS as well


##Why does this repository exist
This repository is meant to showcase a simple game, while keeping extendability/ maintainability in mind. The main focus is code and not so much gameplay/art.


##Potential ideas for later updates
* More moletypes with different behaviours:
 * Jumping moles that dissapear
 * Heavy moles you have to hit multiple times
 * GOLDEN MOLES that run around and are worth more points
* Different ScoreControllers with different behaviours
 * Combo score, if you hit moles within a specific time after eachother you get more points
 * If you have multiple types of moles, you get more points if you hit the same types after eachother(or the opposite)
* Have actual good artwork for background


##Disclaimers
* I know penguins are not moles. The reason they exist is to showcase how you can add multiple different types of 'moles' in the game. The actual usage would have been something like different colors that require other approaches to be 'killed'._besides: the game is a whac-a-mole variant, but it does not have to be a mole you hit_
* My art folders are as structured as I want them to be. The art itself was taken from a [free package](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/lovely-animals-pack-92629) on the Unity Store. I did not rename any of the assets in that package since that was not the focus of this project.


##Thanks
Thanks to Rick Veenstra for giving me feedback and pointing out that penguins are not moles. _(and recommending me to write a readme)_
